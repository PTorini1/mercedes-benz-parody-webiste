# Mercedes-Benz 

https://ptorini1.github.io/mercedes-benz-parody-webiste/

This project was made during the second semester of System Development Course in Senai Manuel Garcia Filho.

We're supposed to make the brazilian version of Mercedes-Benz website better (In that moment the website was very out of date). So we decided to use a lot of creative and fun to make it better.

In this project I developed the home page and the calculator page besides the header and footer. I hope you enjoy it and have a lot of fun. 

Project Group: @Hyzark, @LuanPereira2005, @zMSLz, @BrenoMonteiro5 and me.
